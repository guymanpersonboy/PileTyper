JavaScript typing game

## Game Development Tutorial
[HTML5 tutorial](https://spicyyoghurt.com/tutorials/html5-javascript-game-development/develop-a-html5-javascript-game) I am following.
Note: the tutorial only helped me set up a means of drawing shapes, creating a simple game loop, collision detection, and physics. Any typing game functionality and data management was done mostly by me.
